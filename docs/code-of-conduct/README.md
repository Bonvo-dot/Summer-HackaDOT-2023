# Code Of Conduct

Our hackathon event adheres to a strict code of conduct. Harassment includes any offensive verbal comments that relate to a person's gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, and sexual images in public spaces. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We encourage participants to take photographs, but only after giving other participants a reasonable chance to opt-out. If someone objects to being photographed, we request that their request be respected. It is not appropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as bathrooms.

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Additionally, all hacks created at our hackathon event are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Our sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Specifically, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other materials. Sponsor representatives, including volunteers, should not wear sexualized clothing, uniforms, or costumes or create a sexualized environment.

If any participant experiences or witnesses harassment or has any other concerns, we ask them to contact a member of the hackathon staff immediately. Our staff is happy to help participants contact local security or law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon.

We expect all participants to follow these rules at all venues, workshops, and hackathon-related social events. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the hackathon with no refund. We value your attendance and strive to create a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
