## Bonvo Experiences Flow

![Experiences Flow](./BonvoXP.png "Experiences Flow")

1. The blue flow indicates the creation of a new experience.
    * The Bonvo Platform will mint a new NFT with experience metadata into the Bonvo Experiences Collection. These NFTs will be used to receive Soulbound Reputation Badges by users of the Experience.
    * In parallel, the platform we deploy an entirely new Collection, through the Experience Deployer. This extra level is needed due to size limitations of EVM chains. The new contract will be a collection of NFTs exclusively for that experience, where each NFT will be a ticket for a specific date.
    * This collection, and the expence NFT are both owned by the experience creator.
2. The red flow shows the buying of the ticket. 
    * The platform keeps track of the tickets contract associated with each experience so we can have buyers interact directly with the right one. When the buy N tickets, N NFTs are minted on the collection and owned by the buyer.
    * The next step, not shown in the image is to use and validate tickets. Once the ticket owner arrives to the experience location, they will be asked to use the ticket with some specific one time memo.
    * Once done, the owner of the experience can validate that such ticket was used with the requested memo and allow the ticket holder to join.
    * The ticket cannot be used again but it can be hold indefinitely as proof as attentance.
3. The green flow shows the badge flow.
    * After using the ticket, the holder can drop a reputation badge to the linked experience NFT, which will serve to indicate the quality of the experience, either good or bad.

The badge functionality, and charding tokens for tickets is yet to be implemented in the contract side. All the other flows are complete.

## Relay Chain Calls
We are adding the possibility to interact with the Bonvo Experiences contracts directly from the relay chain. Currently we have to steps implemented: approving of ERC20 token, and registering a new user. 

This requires a 3 step process:
1. Build the EVM transaction data
2. Build the XCM message which will withdraw DEV tokens, buy execution and run the EVM transaction.
3. Sign and send from the relay chain. The signing is done using Polkadot.js or Talisman. Other wallets which interact directly with the relay chain can be added.

In the near future, we will add all the other operations and allow the platform to be used either from EVM or the Relay Chain.
