# Helpful Resources

This doc includes useful references of how to start building a DApp with ink!

## Astar Network

[Astar Network](https://astar.network) is one of the parachain in Polkadot which provides the infrastructure of building dApps with EVM and [WASM](https://webassembly.org) smart contract. For this topic, you will focus on this WASM-based contract, which is **ink!**

## What is ink?

[ink!](https://use.ink) is a smart contract langague for Substrate-based chains, which are compiled to WASM. Check the [repository](https://github.com/paritytech/ink)

## Development Tools

### Setup Environment

This section is for the beginner if you don't know how to set up the required environments.

### Swanky Suite 

Astart has provided a great tool, Swanky Suite, to build Wasm smart contract. **Swanky Suite aims to be an "all-in-one" tool for Wasm smart contract developers.**
