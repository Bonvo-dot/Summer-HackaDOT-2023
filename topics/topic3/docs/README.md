## Cross-Chain Connected Contracts

Connected contracts refer to the cooperation of smart contracts on the “backend” of the DApps users interact with on the blockchain. These contracts are connected across blockchains so there is no need to bridge assets in order to use assets in any application, on any connected chain.
