# Helpful Resources

_This docs include helpful resources to get start with building a Parachain project_ 

## Polkadot Guide

Before you dive into building a parachain, it would be great to have a look at the architecture of Polkadot and how it works

## Development Tools
### Substrate

SDK for building blockchain written in Rust. **Blockchain development is complex.** It involves sophisticated technologiesâ€”including advanced cryptography and distributed network. Substrate makes this high barriers of developing core of blockchain lower with high flexibility.

### Cumulus

SDK for building a parachain. Cumulus is a a set of tools for writing **Substrate-based Polkadot parachains**.

### Polkadot

Polkadot node([Relay Chain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain)) implementation.

### Zombienet

A cli tool to easily spawn ephemeral Polkadot/Substrate networks and perform tests against them. Even if you have built your own Substrate-based parachain, it is hard to create test environment for relay chain and parachain. **Zombienet aims to be a testing framework for Substrate based blockchains,** providing pre-built environment of relay chain and parachain
