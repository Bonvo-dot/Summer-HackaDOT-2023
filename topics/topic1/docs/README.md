# Helpful Resources

_This docs include helpful resources to get start with a Parachain project_ 

## Substrate

SDK for building blockchain written in Rust. **Blockchain development is complex.** It involves sophisticated technologiesâ€”including advanced cryptography and distributed network. Substrate makes this high barriers of developing core of blockchain lower with high flexibility.

## Cumulus

SDK for building parachain. Cumulus is a a set of tools for writing **Substrate-based Polkadot parachains**.

## Polkadot

Polkadot node implementation.

## Zombienet

A cli tool to easily spawn ephemeral Polkadot/Substrate networks and perform tests against them. Even if you have built your own Substrate-based parachain, it is hard to create test environment for relay chain and parachain. **Zombienet aims to be a testing framework for Substrate based blockchains,** providing pre-built environment of relay chain and parachain
