> Mentor: Astar

In this category, we want you to push the limits of whatâ€™s possible. Be creative, break things, make us laugh, make us cry. Test suites, visualizations, Wasm interoperability, and everything in between qualifies for this category. Shock us with your brilliance.

- Transpiler for smart contracts providing interoperability with Wasm
- Application written in EVM contract, running on Substrate chain (ex: using XVM)
- Application written in Wasm contract, running on Substrate chain (ex: ink!)
