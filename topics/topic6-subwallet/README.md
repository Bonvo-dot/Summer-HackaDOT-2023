# Topic 6 : Support Asymmetric encryption/decryption feature
> Mentor: SubWallet 

## Description

The way to add the asymmetric encryption/decryption feature than the one already implemented, **which does not work with sr25519**

It works more like the _eth decrypt function from Metamask_, where only one public key/private key pair is involved: you can encrypt data with the public key of the recipient, and only this recipient can decrypt the data with his private/secret key
