# Teams

*Directory for the teams related to topic 4*

## Guideline

1. You should create folder named after your team name (e.g `HackaDOT`). 

2. Create 
- `src`: All code related to your project. 
- `docs`: Any kind of supporting docs of your project
    - Detailed decription of your project(`*.pdf`)
    - logo images(`*.png`)
- `README.md`: Overview of your project
    - Description of your project
    - How to run you code

```
teams
ㄴ HackaDOT
    ㄴ src
    ㄴ docs
    ㄴ README.md
```

3. PR
- Send PR to commit for your update to `main` branch.
- **Work will only be evaluated if pushed to the `main` branch in Github, all other branches will be ignored.**
