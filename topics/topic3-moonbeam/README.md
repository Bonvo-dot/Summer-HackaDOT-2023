# Topic 3: Build a Connected Contract DApp(feat. Moonbeam)
> Mentor: Moonbeam Network

Description: Build a connected contract/cross-dapp using Moonbeam and any GMP protocol. 

**Moonbeam** is the best place to build a cross-chain / connected contract thanks to its extensive interoperability. Moonbeamâ€™s interoperability within Polkadot is enabled by Polkadot's native GMP, called XCM. 

Moonbeam has integrated with **[GMP protocols](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview)** including Wormhole, Axelar, Hyperlane, and LayerZero to connect to other ecosystems like Ethereum, Avalanche, Cosmos, and more. 

With Moonbeam, developers can build applications that connect to any contract on any chain. Using a GMP protocol such as Axelar, you can call a contract on a remote chain. Examples include making a cross chain asset transfer, trading an asset on a remote chain, bridging NFTs, and more. Requirements

- Smart contract deployed to a Moonbeam network.
- Use a GMP protocol to take any kind of cross-chain action.
