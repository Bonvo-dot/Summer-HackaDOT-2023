# Helpful Resources

This doc includes how to build on Moobeam and using GMP protocol

## Moonbeam Network

[Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network) is the most EVM-compatible blockchain in Polkadot ecosystem. The Moonbeam platform extends the base Ethereum feature set with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations.

## Building on Moonbeam

[Learn how to build a new application](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/) or deploy existing Solidity/Vyper smart contracts to Moonbeam, Moonriver, or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

## Cross-Chain Connected Contracts

Connected contracts refer to the cooperation of smart contracts on the “backend” of the DApps users interact with on the blockchain. These contracts are connected across blockchains so there is no need to bridge assets in order to use assets in any application, on any connected chain.
